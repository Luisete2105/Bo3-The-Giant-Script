# How to use

Just download the realase version ( **https://github.com/Luisete2105/Bo3-The-Giant-Script/releases/latest** ) extract it, then follow the 'How to use.txt' which says:

1. Choose if you want attachments or not on your starter pistol, for attachments go MR6 folder
2. Select your client,steam or boiii, right click on the "client"+_inject.ps1 and hit "Run with PowerShell"
3. To apply changes do a map_restart if you are mid game
4. Press any key on the console to stop injecting and do a map restart if you are mid game to aply changes

I suggest not moving on your very first attempt, the buttons layout will disappear as soon as you move after the first couple seconds of the current game, they are only shown at your first attempt or when you switch modes.

As you can see, I added an autorestarter, when activated it will do a fast_restart if your first OR second zombie didnt spawn on the needed window (I hope this brings some new players to The Giant COPIUM).

This script gives automatically the RK5 and sets the first gum hit free even if you are playing offline, also in case you dont have attachments on a pistol, you will be granted the reddot, quickdraw and laser sight as they are the best ones for The Giant EE (with the exception of the MR6 which is decided by entering the folder you wish).

Thats it, have fun and happy Giant!.

This script doesnt support:
*Mods
*Coop
*Any map besides The Giant

If I see there is a lot of people who wants coop version I may add it, I am not sure about adding support for other maps since The Giant is the simplest map and it was already a lot of work, so if I ever add another map, it wont be as detailed as The Giant.
