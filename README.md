# How to use

Just download the realase version, right click on the bo3 versi√≥n you are going to play (Steam/Boiii) and select "Run with PoweShell".

To stop the script just click any key while having the console open.

If you are mid game, just do a map_restart and the script will be applied.

This script doesnt support:
-Mods
-Coop
-Any map besides The Giant

If I see there is a lot of people who wants coop version I may add it, I am not sure about adding support for other maps since The Giant is the simplest map and it was already a lot of work, so if I ever add another map, it wont be as detailed as The Giant.
